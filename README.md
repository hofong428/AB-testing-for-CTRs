Running effective A/B Testing from BERT model
A/B testing is one of the most popular controlled experiments used to optimize web marketing strategies. It allows decision makers to choose the best design for a website by looking at the analytics results obtained with two possible alternatives A and B.  
There are 3 A/B testing stats to help you see the importance of A/B testing web emails.

1. Brands split on split testing
This is important because it indicates that we have an edge over the brands that donâ€™t test their emails. 
By A/B testing emails, you can ensure that emails are performing at their best.

2. Small changes make big differences
When it comes to A/B testing emails, small changes can make big differences.
While no 2 emails and email marketing campaigns are the same, it is safe to say that a better version of email will bring some significant changes to engagement rates and revenue, and the only way to know that better version is through split testing.
